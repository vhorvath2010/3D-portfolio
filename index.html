    <h1>Vincent <br> Horvath</h1>

    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>I am Vincent, a computer science student at Georgia Tech focusing on intelligence, modeling and simulation, and astrophysics. I am President of the Google Developer Student Club at GT and am wrapping up my summer's work as a Digital Innovation intern for Westinghouse Electric Company where I modernized the workflow of procedures and developed an augmented reality application for steam generator training.</p>

    <br>

    <p>I am joining the <a target="_blank" href="https://cosmo.gatech.edu/">Computational Cosmology Group</a> headed by Dr. John Wise this fall 2022 to assist with simulations of the early universe. In the fall of 2021 I worked under doctoral student Anh Thai in <a target="_blank" href="https://rehg.org/">Rehg Lab</a> and created a distance-based loss function for a machine learning model. The model creates 3D shapes represented by signed distance fields from single 2D images. I have also worked with the University of Pennsylvania's aviary in the summer of 2021 to use spectrogram analysis and RNN technology to identify cowbird songs in audio data.</p>
